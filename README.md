## Quik

Quik is different from other dating apps in that it isn't designed for you to swipe endlessly, and rarely if ever meet with a person in real life.

Just the opposite, with Quik you pin locations you're already interested in going to and then start to look for potential matches from there.

To add to the mystery (and also provide a layer of security), you won't know the exact location you matched with anyone until you've had a chance to chat and mutually agree to reveal it.

TESTING NOTE: Quik is a real time connections app with a live chat feature. If you'd like to test the chat and connections you must log in with two users on two separte browsers (ie, Chrome and Safari) as Quik currently makes use of local storage in its authentication.
